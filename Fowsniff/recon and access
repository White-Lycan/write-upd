Initial scan of target revealed ports 110/tcp (pop3) and 143/tcp (imap) to be open, suggesting this was a mail server of sorts.

There was also a web server running on port 80 and navigating to the site reveals that the company recently suffered an attack and their internal employee username:password info was stolen.

A google search of the company name brings up results for a twitter page that eventually leads to a github dump where the emails and their MD5 hashes (I know...) were leaked.

Cracking the hashes with hashkiller.io provides the passwords and the using nc I was able to connect with one of the accounts, seina, to the pop3 mail server.

From here, the user has two emails in her inbox, one of which seems to be from the admin of the team who provided them with a temp password to log in, stating it needed to be changed.

Seina appears to have changed hers as it won't work for SSH. But using hydra to combine the users and the new temp pw grants us access to another account.

From here, the room has no further questions which yield points.
